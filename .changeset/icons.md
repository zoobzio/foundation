Icons. A new `@zoobzio/icons` package carries the foundation icon contract: the roles the components of `@zoobzio/vue` leave to their `*Icon` slots (`prev`, `next`, `close`, `search`, `sort-asc`, …), authored as an icon-sheets config and built by `@icon-sheets/kit` into a typed `Alias` union, a resolved contract, and sprites.

The Nuxt layer loads `@icon-sheets/nuxt` with that contract as its default `iconSheets` option, so an app that extends the layer gets `<Icon name="…" />` and the sprite with no setup, and an app with its own icons package merges its contract over the foundation's by passing it the usual way. `#imports` carries `IconAlias`, the app's merged alias union.

`@zoobzio/vue` gains `wrap` (`utils/wrap`): a component with a `pt` layer and slot defaults, typed as the component itself, for a framework layer to stand in for the component with its own parts and defaults laid under the consumer's. The item types (`MenuItem`, `TabsOption`, `SegmentedControlOption`, `BreadcrumbItem`, `DirectoryItem`, `CommandOption`, `FacetItem`, and the action and crumb items over them) are interfaces now, so a layer may widen one by declaration merging; `TreeNode` stays an alias for reka's record bound. `useExplicit` is gone: it served the layer's former wrappers, which `wrap` replaces.

The Nuxt layer's wrappers are each one `wrap` call, so the nine link wrappers are a `pt` line each. The menu is the first component to draw icons: the layer widens `MenuItem` with an optional `icon: IconAlias` in its `app.d.ts`, and the menu wrapper fills the `itemIcon` slot with that icon by default; a consumer's own `itemIcon` slot still wins.
