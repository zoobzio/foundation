`usePassthrough`, `useContext`, and `useExplicit` serve a wrapper.

- `usePassthrough({ pt, layer })` lays a partial manifest under the consumer's `pt` and returns the layered partial, for a wrapper to hand on as the wrapped component's `pt`. A function part composes as it does over recipes. `PassthroughLayer` types the source; `layer` in `utils/passthrough` is the merge.
- `useContext(source)` forwards a wrapped component's context unchanged, `undefined` until it mounts.
- `useExplicit(props)` projects the props the consumer passed explicitly, read off the vnode, so a wrapper hands them on without casting an absent boolean to `false` or turning a model controlled. `explicit` and `isExplicit` in `utils/explicit` are the projection and the presence check; `useModel`'s `explicit` option uses the latter.
- `PT` keeps a constructor whole, as it does an array, so a component passed through `as` keeps its signature. A `DefineComponent` such as `NuxtLink` now typechecks as a `pt.link` override.
