Add `tel` and `url` to the text field types, and a `TemporalField` for native string date and time inputs: `time`, `datetime-local`, and `date-input`, which renders `<input type="date">` with a `YYYY-MM-DD` string value. The `date` type stays the `Date`-valued picker. The form field now forwards `maxLength` on text and textarea fields, `minDate` and `maxDate` on date fields, and `required` on checkbox, multi-select, date, and tags-input fields. The date picker gains `required`, `minValue`, and `maxValue` props, and the multi-select and tags input gain `required`.
