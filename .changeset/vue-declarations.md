"@zoobzio/vue": patch
---

`@zoobzio/vue` ships declarations. `build` emits `.d.ts` for every source file, `.vue.d.ts` beside each component, into `.dist`, and the exports map serves them under the `types` condition while `default` stays on the source. A consumer's typecheck resolves real declaration files, so a pnpm workspace link no longer loads the package twice, and `skipLibCheck` covers it.
