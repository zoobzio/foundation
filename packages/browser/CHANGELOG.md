### Patch Changes

- [`c7176a7`](https://github.com/zoobzio/foundation/commit/c7176a7de302090d2568733b6d3fb8b574fba48b) Thanks [@zoobzio](https://github.com/zoobzio)! - Icons. A new `@zoobzio/icons` package carries the foundation icon contract: the roles the components of `@zoobzio/vue` leave to their `*Icon` slots (`prev`, `next`, `close`, `search`, `sort-asc`, …), authored as an icon-sheets config and built by `@icon-sheets/kit` into a typed `Alias` union, a resolved contract, and sprites.

  The Nuxt layer loads `@icon-sheets/nuxt` with that contract as its default `iconSheets` option, so an app that extends the layer gets `<Icon name="…" />` and the sprite with no setup, and an app with its own icons package merges its contract over the foundation's by passing it the usual way. `#imports` carries `IconAlias`, the app's merged alias union.

  A part of `@zoobzio/vue` that renders one of the package's own components is typed `Rendered` (`RenderedIter` per item): the component's props plus `as`, the component rendered, which a recipe names and a consumer's `pt` swaps. The template renders such a part through the package's own `Primitive` component (`components/primitive.vue`): `as` names the component, the rest is its props, and the parent's slots are handed on whole, named ones included, where reka's `Primitive` forwards the default alone. It is a component of the package like any other, so a consumer may render through it too. The parts: the table's `search`, `refresh`, and `pagination`; the pagination's `first`, `prev`, `next`, `last`, and `size`; the row and file `rowCheckbox`, `actionsMenu`, and `actionsTrigger`; the folders' `actionsMenu` and `actionsTrigger`; the table head's `selectAllCheckbox`; the browser's `breadcrumb` and `refresh`; the command's `viewport` and `itemCheckbox`; the multi-select's `itemCheckbox`; the date filters' `popover`, `trigger`, `fieldCommand`, `operatorCommand`, `calendar`, and `rangeCalendar`; the facets', column manager's, and keywords' `trigger` and the command or inputs behind it; and a form field's eight control parts. The fielder's recipes are typed `FormFieldRecipes`, the manifest without `as`, which the field component adds. The popovers of the facets, column manager, and keywords stay direct renders, since they hold a template ref.

  `@zoobzio/vue` gains `wrap` (`utils/wrap`): a component with a `pt` layer and slot defaults, typed as the component itself, for a framework layer to stand in for the component with its own parts and defaults laid under the consumer's. The item types (`MenuItem`, `TabsOption`, `SegmentedControlOption`, `BreadcrumbItem`, `DirectoryItem`, `CommandOption`, `FacetItem`, and the action and crumb items over them) are interfaces now, so a layer may widen one by declaration merging; `TreeNode` stays an alias for reka's record bound. `useExplicit` is gone: it served the layer's former wrappers, which `wrap` replaces.

  The `*Icon` slots are gone from every component of `@zoobzio/vue` (`triggerIcon`, `itemIcon`, `prevIcon`, `nextIcon`, `closeIcon`, `sortIcon`, `refreshIcon`, and the rest, 48 in all). In their place each site has a `prepend` and an `append` slot around the content, with the scope the icon slot had: `itemPrepend`/`itemAppend` (menu, command, directory, segmented control, breadcrumb, tree, autocomplete), `triggerPrepend`/`triggerAppend` (select, multi-select, tabs, accordion, the pickers), `prevPrepend`/`prevAppend` and `nextPrepend`/`nextAppend` (calendars and pickers), `closePrepend`/`closeAppend` (toast), `itemDeletePrepend`/`itemDeleteAppend` (tags input), `itemRemovePrepend`/`itemRemoveAppend` (file input), `backToTopPrepend`/`backToTopAppend` (scroller), `toolPrepend`/`toolAppend` (editor), `headerPrepend`/`headerAppend` and `dragPrepend`/`dragAppend` (table head), `bulkActionPrepend`/`bulkActionAppend` (bulk actions), `actionPrepend`/`actionAppend` (table rows, browser files), and `folderPrepend`/`folderAppend` and `folderActionPrepend`/`folderActionAppend` (browser folders). A site that showed placeholder text under its icon slot (the pickers' "Calendar", "Previous", and "Next", the toast's "Close", the tag and file "Remove") keeps the text between the pair. The checkbox's own `icon` slot stays.

  The Fab is one item, so it has one default slot in place of its label text, and no `icon`, `prepend`, or `append`. A component that renders a Fab as a part has one slot that replaces the part, with the part's `settings` in scope: the table's and browser's `refresh`, a table row's and a browser file's `actions`, a browser folder's `folderActions`, the column manager's `columns`, and the pagination's `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last`; the facets', keywords', and date filters' `trigger` already replaced theirs. The pairs those sites forwarded into the Fab are gone.

  The action shapes of `@zoobzio/table` and `@zoobzio/browser` (`RowAction`, `FileAction`, `FolderAction`, and the two `BulkAction`s) extend their `ActionDescriptor`, so a field added to the descriptor by declaration merging reaches the service's live actions and the menu items built from them. The Nuxt layer widens both descriptors with an optional `icon: IconAlias`, as it does `MenuItem`. `EditorTool` is an interface for the same reason.

  The contract of `@zoobzio/icons` grows to forty aliases: `filter` and `keywords` for the facets' and keywords' triggers, `remove` for a tag's or file's remove button, and the editor's tools (`bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `strike`, `code`, `heading`, `bullet-list`, `ordered-list`, `blockquote`, `code-block`, `rule`, `undo`, `redo`). The Nuxt layer now wraps thirty components (`WRAPPED`), and every icon site draws its alias by default: the accordion, select, and multi select draw `expand`, the calendars and pickers `prev`, `next`, and `calendar`, the command `search`, the tags input and file input `remove`, the toast `close`, the scroller `top`, the checkbox `check`, the editor and rich text their tools' icons (`EDITOR_TOOL_ICONS`, `toolIcon`), the tree `expand` as a branch's toggle, and the table and browser `refresh`, `columns`, `actions`, `drag`, `sort-asc`/`sort-desc`, `folder`, and the pagination's four. A slot that replaces a Fab renders the part with the icon as its content, so the label stays the `aria-label`. An item draws its own `icon`: the layer widens `Option` (so every option type), `BreadcrumbItem`, `DirectoryItem`, and `FacetItem` beside `MenuItem`, and `createTable`'s and `createBrowser`'s actions carry one through their descriptors. Where a vue component renders another as a part, the wrapper lays the layer's wrapped component under the part's `as`: the table's pagination, column manager command, and checkboxes; the browser's checkboxes; the form's fields and a field's controls; and the facets', keywords', and date filters' popover contents.

  The form renders its fields through a `field` part (`RenderedIter<Field<T>, FormFieldProps<T>>`), so a layer's `pt.field` swaps the field component. `useForward` gains a part form for it: an entry with no `component` takes the component from its getter's `as`, as a `Rendered` recipe carries it. `Surface` (behind `wrap`'s option types) reads a generic SFC's props and slots from its call signature's parameters rather than its render result, which a self-referential bound (the tree's) left uninferrable. `useScroller` reads reka's exposed `viewportElement` where the viewport component has one, since a fragment-rooted viewport's `$el` is its anchor, not the scrolling element; the scroller's back-to-top control now appears on scroll.

  The Nuxt layer's wrappers are each one `wrap` call, so the nine link wrappers are a `pt` line each. The table's and browser's wrappers name the layer's `Menu` for row, file, and folder actions and the layer's `Breadcrumb` for the browser's trail through those parts' `as`. The menu is the first component to draw icons: the layer widens `MenuItem` with an optional `icon: IconAlias` in its `app.d.ts`, and the menu wrapper fills `itemPrepend` with that icon by default; a consumer's own `itemPrepend` slot still wins.

It defaults to `UTC`, so a server and a browser render the same text and hydration no longer depends on the process zone. A calendar day, `YYYY-MM-DD`, always formats in UTC: a day has no zone to shift it into the one before. `cell` in `@zoobzio/vue` takes the zone as its fifth argument.
